# 🦜🔗 LangChain Experiments
Welcome to my **LangChain learning and projects repository**!  
This repo contains hands-on experiments, practice code, and mini-projects I built while exploring **LangChain**, a framework for building applications powered by LLMs (Large Language Models).

## 📌 What’s Inside
- 🔍 **Basic LangChain Components** – prompts, chains, memory
- 📂 **Practical Examples** – simple scripts to test concepts  
- 🤖 **Mini Projects** – applying LangChain in real-world inspired use cases  
- 📝 **Notes & Learnings** – key takeaways from my LangChain journey  

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is mainly for:
- Practicing **LangChain concepts step by step**  
- Documenting my **learning journey**  
- Building a foundation for **future AI-powered projects**
